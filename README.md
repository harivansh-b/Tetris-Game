There are seven blocks which spawn randomly with different colors.

We need to stack the blocks and clear as many lines as possible.

While progressing the level and speed increases.

Also, we can view the next spawning block so we can plan accordingly to place the next spawning block.

There are also three game options namely: Play (Resumes the paused game), Pause (Pauses the game) and Refresh (Restarts a game i.e. starts a new game).

There are four controls to control the block: Up (Rotate the block to 90⁰ clockwise), Right and Left (Move right and left) and Down (Drop the block suddenly).
